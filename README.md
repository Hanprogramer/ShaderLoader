# ShaderLoader

Opinionated template for an Amethyst Mod, will be the base mod used in all amethyst guides! Follow the steps below to build the mod

## Installing a shader
1. Go into your com.mojang folder and create a folder in (if not exists) `AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\amethyst\shaders\` (if doesn't exists run the mod once to create the shaders folder automatically)
2. Extract your shaders there
3. Run the game. (shaderlist.txt is not implemented yet so dont bother with it, all the shaders inside the shaders folder will be loaded)

## Creating a shader
1. Go into your com.mojang folder and create a folder in `AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\amethyst\shaders\` (if doesn't exists run the mod once to create the shaders folder automatically)
2. Add a shader.json inside your folder
3. Inside the shader.json put the name:
```JSON
{
   "name": "My Shader"
}
```
4. Anything in the `AppData\Roaming\Amethyst\Versions\Minecraft-1.21.0.3\data\renderer` will be redirected into your shader folder. So create folders accordingly, if you want to override `materials` then create that folder in your shaders folder, then put your custom materials in there.
5. To create custom materials use v0.2.1 of [Lazurite by Veka](https://veka0.github.io/lazurite/)
5. Run the game. (shaderlist.txt is not implemented yet so dont bother with it, all the shaders inside the shaders folder will be loaded)

## Building

1. To generate a visual studio solution run the command:
```
xmake project -k vsxmake -m "release"
```

2. Open the `.sln` file in `./vsxmake2022`

3. To build your project, either press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in visual studio OR run the `xmake` command

4. To build your RP/BP run these commands
```
cd data
rgl watch
```

## Mod Build Config

`extra_deps` - An array of projects to add with `add_deps()`
`extra_links` - An array of projects to link with your mod using `add_links()`
`extra_include_dirs` - An array of extra directories to include
`extra_header_files` - An array of extra header files to include
`extra_files` - An array of extra files to use

## Additional Information

Any textures placed into the textures/items will automatically be included into an `item_textures.json` file that is generated by `data/packs/RP/textures/item_texture.ts`. 

The icon identifier is determined by the file name, i.e. `textures/items/example_item.png` will become `amethyst_template:example_item`
